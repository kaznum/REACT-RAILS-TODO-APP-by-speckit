# Specification Quality Checklist: TODO Management Application with Priority and Deadline

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All validation items have passed. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Validation Notes

1. **Content Quality**: Specification focuses on user needs and business value without mentioning specific technologies (React, Rails) in the requirements. Technical details are appropriately excluded.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 24 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No clarification markers remain - all ambiguities were resolved with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section.

3. **Success Criteria**: All 13 success criteria are measurable, technology-agnostic, and user-focused. Examples:
   - "Users can complete authentication using Google OAuth2 in under 30 seconds" (measurable, user-focused)
   - "Priority filtering updates the displayed list within 1 second" (measurable, no technical implementation details)
   - "90% of users report that priority sorting helps them focus" (qualitative, user satisfaction)

4. **Acceptance Scenarios**: All 6 user stories have complete Given-When-Then scenarios covering happy paths, validation errors, and edge cases.

5. **Scope Boundaries**: Clear "Out of Scope" section with 20+ explicitly excluded features to prevent scope creep.

6. **Assumptions**: 16 documented assumptions covering defaults for ambiguous areas (deadline format, tie-breaking, session management, etc.)

## Next Steps

The specification is ready for:
- `/speckit.clarify` - If additional clarification questions are needed
- `/speckit.plan` - To proceed with technical planning and implementation design

**Recommendation**: Proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` as the specification is complete and unambiguous.
