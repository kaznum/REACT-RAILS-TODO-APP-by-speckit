**Feature Branch**: `001-todo-google-oauth2`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "TODO管理をするアプリで、一覧、登録、編集、削除機能、Google OAuth2によるログイン・ログアウト機能を有する。TODOの属性には、TODO名、優先順位（高中低）、期限、完了フラグ(完了・未完了。デフォルトは未完了)がありTODO名は必須である。デフォルトでは優先順位・期限の順に並び、優先順位で絞り込みができる。"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09

- Q: How should users toggle TODO completion status from the list view? → A: Checkbox next to each TODO item that users can click
- Q: What is the maximum character length for TODO names? → A: 255 characters (medium, single sentence)
- Q: When a user's session expires during active use, what should happen? → A: Show immediate modal/dialog requiring re-login, discard unsaved work
- Q: What is the expected maximum number of TODO items per user? → A: 5000+ items (unlimited/archival use)
- Q: How should users input deadline dates? → A: Calendar picker (visual date selector)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User Authentication (Priority: P1)

Users need to securely access their personal TODO lists by authenticating through their Google account, ensuring data privacy and eliminating the need to create and remember new credentials.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is the foundation for all other features. Without it, users cannot access personalized TODO lists or ensure data security.

**Independent Test**: Users can sign in using Google OAuth2, see a personalized welcome screen, and sign out successfully. This can be tested without any TODO items existing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the application homepage, **When** they click "Sign in with Google", **Then** they are redirected to Google's authentication page
2. **Given** a user completes Google authentication successfully, **When** they are redirected back to the application, **Then** they see their personalized dashboard with their name/email displayed
3. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they click "Sign Out", **Then** they are logged out and redirected to the login page
4. **Given** a user who previously signed in, **When** they return to the application, **Then** their session is maintained and they remain logged in
5. **Given** a user denies Google authentication, **When** they are redirected back, **Then** they see an error message and remain on the login page
6. **Given** a user's session expires while using the application, **When** they attempt any action, **Then** they see a modal/dialog requiring re-authentication and any unsaved work is discarded

---

### User Story 2 - View TODO List with Priority Sorting (Priority: P2)

Users need to see all their TODO items sorted by priority (High, Medium, Low) and deadline to focus on the most urgent and important tasks first.

**Why this priority**: Viewing TODOs with proper organization is the primary use case and must work before users can manage items effectively.

**Independent Test**: An authenticated user with existing TODO items can view their complete list sorted by priority first, then deadline, with all item details visible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user with TODO items of different priorities, **When** they access the TODO list page, **Then** they see items sorted with High priority first, then Medium, then Low
2. **Given** an authenticated user with TODO items of the same priority, **When** they view the list, **Then** items are sorted by deadline (earliest first) within each priority group
3. **Given** an authenticated user with no TODO items, **When** they access the TODO list page, **Then** they see an empty state message prompting them to create their first TODO
4. **Given** an authenticated user viewing their TODO list, **When** the list loads, **Then** each item displays a checkbox for completion status, TODO name, priority level, and deadline
5. **Given** multiple users in the system, **When** a user views their TODO list, **Then** they only see their own items, not other users' items
6. **Given** an authenticated user viewing their TODO list, **When** items are displayed, **Then** completed items show a checked checkbox and are visually distinct from incomplete items (e.g., different styling or strikethrough)

---

### User Story 3 - Filter TODOs by Priority (Priority: P3)

Users need to filter their TODO list by priority level to focus on specific urgency levels and reduce cognitive load when planning their work.

**Why this priority**: Filtering enables users to manage large TODO lists more effectively, but the core functionality works without it.

**Independent Test**: An authenticated user can select a priority filter (High, Medium, Low, or All) and see only matching TODO items.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user viewing their TODO list, **When** they select "High" priority filter, **Then** only High priority items are displayed
2. **Given** an authenticated user viewing their TODO list, **When** they select "Medium" priority filter, **Then** only Medium priority items are displayed
3. **Given** an authenticated user viewing their TODO list, **When** they select "Low" priority filter, **Then** only Low priority items are displayed
4. **Given** an authenticated user with a priority filter active, **When** they select "All" or clear the filter, **Then** all TODO items are displayed again
5. **Given** filtered TODO items, **When** displayed, **Then** they maintain the default sort order (priority, then deadline)
6. **Given** a user with a priority filter active, **When** no items match the selected priority, **Then** they see a message indicating no items found for that priority level

---

### User Story 4 - Create TODO Items (Priority: P4)

Users need to quickly add new tasks with a name, priority level, and deadline to capture responsibilities and plan their work effectively.

**Why this priority**: Creating items is essential but only valuable after users can view and filter their list.

**Independent Test**: An authenticated user can create a new TODO item with all required/optional information and immediately see it in their list in the correct sorted position.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user on the TODO list page, **When** they click "Add TODO", **Then** they see a form to create a new item with fields for name (text input), priority (dropdown), and deadline (calendar picker)
2. **Given** a user filling out the TODO creation form, **When** they enter a name, select a priority (High/Medium/Low), select a deadline using the calendar picker, and click "Save", **Then** the new TODO appears in their list in the correct sorted position with completion status set to "incomplete"
3. **Given** a user creating a TODO, **When** they submit the form with only a name, **Then** they see validation prompts for required priority and deadline fields
4. **Given** a user creating a TODO, **When** they submit the form without a name, **Then** they see a validation error message requiring a TODO name
5. **Given** a user creating a TODO, **When** they enter a name exceeding 255 characters, **Then** they see a validation error indicating the maximum length
6. **Given** a user creating a TODO, **When** they click "Cancel", **Then** the form is closed without creating an item
7. **Given** a newly created TODO, **When** it appears in the list, **Then** its completion status is automatically set to "incomplete"

---

### User Story 5 - Edit TODO Items (Priority: P5)

Users need to modify existing TODO items to update information, adjust priorities, extend deadlines, or mark tasks as complete.

**Why this priority**: Editing adds flexibility as circumstances change but is less critical than basic CRUD operations.

**Independent Test**: An authenticated user can modify an existing TODO's name, priority, deadline, or completion status and see the changes persist with proper re-sorting.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user viewing a TODO item, **When** they click "Edit", **Then** they see a form pre-filled with the current item details: name (text input), priority (dropdown), deadline (calendar picker), and completion status (checkbox)
2. **Given** a user editing a TODO, **When** they modify the name, priority, or deadline and click "Save", **Then** the updated information is displayed and the item is re-sorted if necessary
3. **Given** a user editing a TODO, **When** they change the priority from Low to High, **Then** the item moves to the High priority section of the list
4. **Given** a user editing a TODO, **When** they toggle the completion status from "incomplete" to "complete", **Then** the item is visually marked as completed
5. **Given** a user editing a TODO, **When** they toggle the completion status from "complete" to "incomplete", **Then** the completed styling is removed
6. **Given** a user editing a TODO, **When** they clear the name field and try to save, **Then** they see a validation error
7. **Given** a user editing a TODO, **When** they click "Cancel", **Then** the original information is preserved

---

### User Story 6 - Delete TODO Items (Priority: P6)

Users need to remove completed or irrelevant TODO items to keep their list manageable and focused on current priorities.

**Why this priority**: Deletion is important for list maintenance but not critical for MVP functionality.

**Independent Test**: An authenticated user can delete a TODO item with confirmation, and the item is permanently removed from their list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user viewing a TODO item, **When** they click "Delete", **Then** they see a confirmation dialog
2. **Given** a user sees the delete confirmation dialog, **When** they confirm deletion, **Then** the item is removed from the list permanently
3. **Given** a user sees the delete confirmation dialog, **When** they cancel, **Then** the item remains in the list unchanged
4. **Given** a user deletes their last TODO item, **When** the deletion completes, **Then** they see the empty state message

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user's Google account access is revoked mid-session?
- How does the system handle network failures during authentication callback?
- What happens when a user sets a deadline in the past?
- How does the system handle TODO items with the same priority and deadline (tie-breaking)?
- How does the system handle special characters or emojis in TODO names (within 255 character limit)?
- What happens if Google OAuth2 service is temporarily unavailable?
- How are completed TODO items sorted relative to incomplete items with the same priority and deadline?
- What happens when a user changes a TODO's deadline that affects its position in the sorted list?
- Can a user filter to see only completed or only incomplete items, or is filtering limited to priority only?

### Key Entities

- **User**: Represents an authenticated person using the application, identified by their Google account credentials (email, unique ID). Users own TODO items.
- **TODO Item**: Represents a task to be completed, containing:
  - Name (required, text, 1-255 characters): Description of the task
  - Priority (required, enum): High, Medium, or Low urgency level
  - Deadline (required, date): Target completion date
  - Completion flag (required, enum): "complete" or "incomplete" (defaults to "incomplete")
  - Creation timestamp: When the item was created
  - Relationship to owning user: Which user owns this TODO

## Assumptions

1. **Google OAuth2 Availability**: Google's OAuth2 service is available and accessible
2. **User Google Account**: All users have access to a Google account
3. **Single User per TODO**: TODO items belong to exactly one user (no sharing or collaboration features)
4. **Text-Only TODOs**: TODO items contain only text content (no file attachments, images, or rich media)
5. **No Offline Support**: Application requires internet connection for all operations
6. **Browser Compatibility**: Users access the application through modern web browsers with JavaScript enabled
7. **Deadline Format**: Deadlines are stored as dates (not date-times) and input via calendar picker - time of day is not relevant
8. **Past Deadlines Allowed**: Users can set or keep deadlines in the past for historical tracking
9. **Completed Item Sorting**: Completed TODO items follow the same sorting rules as incomplete items (mixed in list view)
10. **Tie-Breaking**: When priority and deadline are identical, items sort by creation timestamp (oldest first for fair ordering)
11. **Data Retention**: All TODO data is retained indefinitely unless explicitly deleted by the user
12. **Session Management**: Standard web session timeout and security practices apply (minimum 7-day session)
13. **Filter Persistence**: Priority filter selection persists during the user's session but resets to "All" on new login
14. **Completion Toggle**: Users can toggle completion status directly from the list view by clicking a checkbox without opening edit form
15. **Priority and Deadline Required**: Both priority and deadline are required fields when creating a TODO (no optional defaults)
16. **No Completion Date Tracking**: System does not track when a TODO was marked complete, only the current status
17. **Data Volume**: System supports unlimited TODO items per user with performance targets tested up to 5000 items per user
