# Tasks: TODO Management Application with Priority and Deadline

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-todo-google-oauth2/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/openapi.yaml

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL and not included in these tasks (not explicitly requested in spec)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Web app structure: `backend/` and `frontend/` at repository root
- Backend (Rails API): `backend/app/`, `backend/config/`, `backend/db/`
- Frontend (React SPA): `frontend/src/`

- [X] T050 [US2] Create dashboard route in `frontend/src/App.jsx` that renders TodoList with user isolation

**Checkpoint**: Users can view their TODO list sorted correctly. Empty state works. Completed items are visually distinct.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Filter TODOs by Priority (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Users can modify existing TODO items including name, priority, deadline, and completion status

**Independent Test**: User can modify a TODO's attributes and see changes persist with proper re-sorting

### Implementation for User Story 5

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if multiple developers)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5 ‚Üí P6)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires User Story 1 for authentication
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after User Story 2 (depends on TODO list view)
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after User Story 2 (depends on TODO list view)
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after User Story 2 (depends on TODO list view and display)
- **User Story 6 (P6)**: Can start after User Story 2 (depends on TODO list view)

### Within Each User Story

- Backend models/controllers before frontend services
- Services before components
- Core components before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Within each user story: Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- Stories 3, 4, 5, 6 can be worked on in parallel by different team members (all depend on Story 1 + 2)

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch these foundational tasks together (different files):
Task T021: "Create UserSerializer in backend/app/serializers/user_serializer.rb"
Task T022: "Create TodoSerializer in backend/app/serializers/todo_serializer.rb"
Task T024: "Create Axios API client in frontend/src/services/api.js"
Task T025: "Create shared Button component in frontend/src/components/common/Button.jsx"
Task T026: "Create shared Checkbox component in frontend/src/components/common/Checkbox.jsx"
Task T027: "Create shared Modal component in frontend/src/components/common/Modal.jsx"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch these User Story 1 tasks together (different files):
Task T028: "Create AuthController in backend/app/controllers/api/v1/auth_controller.rb"
Task T029: "Create GoogleOAuthService in backend/app/services/google_oauth_service.rb"
Task T031: "Create authService in frontend/src/services/authService.js"
Task T032: "Create useAuth custom hook in frontend/src/hooks/useAuth.js"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Authentication)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (View TODO List)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test authentication and viewing independently
6. Deploy/demo MVP (users can sign in and see their TODOs)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Authentication works
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Viewing works (MVP!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Filtering works
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Creating works
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Editing works
7. Add User Story 6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deleting works (Full CRUD complete)
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Authentication)
3. Once User Story 1 is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (View TODO List)
4. Once User Story 2 is done (authentication + viewing working):
   - Developer A: User Story 3 (Filter)
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (Create)
   - Developer C: User Story 5 (Edit)
   - Developer D: User Story 6 (Delete)
5. Stories 3-6 complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- All commands run in Docker containers per quickstart.md
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens (access: 15min, refresh: 7d) instead of sessions
- **Authorization**: Bearer token in `Authorization` header on all API requests
- **Token Storage**: Access token in localStorage, refresh token in httpOnly cookie
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic retry on 401 via Axios interceptor
- Database is SQLite 3.x embedded in backend container
- Priority stored as INTEGER (0=high, 1=medium, 2=low) with Rails enum
- Completion status stored as INTEGER (0=incomplete, 1=complete)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- No tests included (not requested in spec)
