# Feature Specification: GitHub Actions CI Autofix Workflow

**Feature Branch**: `004-github-actions-ci`
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Github ActionsのCI workflowでテストやLINTがFailureになった場合に、GitHub Actionsのautofix workflowで失敗の箇所を修正するPRを自動的に出す。autofixのworkflowは、https://developers.openai.com/codex/autofix-ci のようにActions secretsで定義されたOPENAI_API_KEYと、openai/codex-action@mainを用いてCodex Action Promptによって修正コードを生成する。Github Actionsのworkflow定義のみを利用し、シェルスクリプトは不要である。"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automated Test Failure Fixes (Priority: P1)

When a developer creates a pull request and CI tests fail, the system waits for all CI jobs to complete, then automatically analyzes the test failures, generates a fix, and commits the corrections directly to the PR's branch. The developer sees the autofix commit in their pull request and can review the proposed changes.

**Why this priority**: This addresses the most critical and frequent scenario - test failures block development progress and consume significant developer time. Automating test fixes provides immediate value by reducing manual debugging effort.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a PR with intentionally failing tests and verifying that autofix commits are automatically added to the PR branch with corrections that make the tests pass.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pull request is opened with failing tests, **When** all CI jobs complete with test failures, **Then** an autofix workflow is triggered automatically
2. **Given** test failures are detected, **When** the autofix workflow analyzes the failures, **Then** fixes are generated and committed to the PR's source branch
3. **Given** fixes are committed, **When** the developer views the PR, **Then** the commit message explains what failures were detected and how they were fixed
4. **Given** autofix cannot resolve all failures, **When** partial fixes are available, **Then** a commit is still created with documentation of remaining issues

---

### User Story 2 - Automated Linting Error Corrections (Priority: P2)

When a pull request has linting errors (formatting, style violations), the system waits for all CI jobs to complete, then automatically corrects these issues following the project's linting rules and commits the fixes to the PR's branch.

**Why this priority**: Linting errors are common but usually straightforward to fix. However, they create friction in the review process. Automating these fixes reduces back-and-forth between reviewers and developers.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a PR with code that violates linting rules and verifying that autofix commits are added with properly formatted code that passes all linting checks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pull request is opened with linting errors, **When** all CI jobs complete with style violations detected, **Then** an autofix workflow is triggered
2. **Given** linting errors are detected, **When** the autofix workflow runs, **Then** code is reformatted and committed to the PR's source branch
3. **Given** linting fixes are applied, **When** CI runs again on the fixed code, **Then** all linting checks pass without introducing new test failures

---

### User Story 3 - Combined Test and Lint Failure Resolution (Priority: P3)

When a pull request has both test failures and linting errors, the system waits for all CI jobs to complete, then intelligently prioritizes and fixes both types of issues in a single autofix commit.

**Why this priority**: While less common than isolated test or lint failures, combined failures do occur. This provides a complete solution but builds on the individual fix capabilities from P1 and P2.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a PR with both failing tests and linting errors, then verifying that a single autofix commit addresses both categories of failures.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pull request has both test and lint failures, **When** all CI jobs complete, **Then** the autofix workflow analyzes both failure types together
2. **Given** multiple failure types are detected, **When** fixes are generated, **Then** a single commit is created that addresses both test failures and lint errors
3. **Given** combined fixes are applied, **When** CI runs again, **Then** all tests pass and all linting checks succeed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the AI-generated fix introduces new test failures or linting errors? (System creates commit with partial fixes and documents remaining issues)
- How does the system handle cases where multiple PRs fail simultaneously? (Each PR gets its own autofix workflow run independently)
- What occurs when the autofix workflow itself encounters errors (API failures, authentication issues)? (System logs clear error messages and does not create commits)
- How does the system behave when fixes cannot be automatically generated (complex logic errors, architectural issues)? (System creates commit with partial fixes if any, documents what could not be fixed)
- What happens if an autofix commit already exists for the current failures? (System checks for existing autofix commits to avoid duplicates)
- How does the system handle PRs that are updated (new commits pushed) while an autofix is being generated? (Autofix workflow operates on the commit that triggered it; new commits trigger new workflow runs)
- What occurs when the AI service API rate limit is reached? (System fails gracefully with error message, retries may be attempted based on rate limit headers)
- How does the system handle very large diffs that might exceed AI token limits? (System processes failures in batches or prioritizes critical failures first)

- **Autofix Request**: Represents a triggered autofix operation, containing the failure context, pull request details, and the type of failures detected (test/lint/both)
- **Autofix Commit**: A commit added to the failing PR's branch that contains AI-generated fixes, includes descriptive commit messages about what was fixed, and may document remaining issues if not all failures could be resolved

- Must respect AI service API rate limits and token limits
- Cannot modify files outside the repository structure
- Must maintain compatibility with existing CI workflow timing and dependencies
- Must not expose API credentials or secrets in logs or commit messages
- Workflow definitions only - no external scripts or custom actions can be created
- Must work with the current CI automation runner environments

## Clarifications

### Workflow Trigger Timing
The autofix workflow will wait for all CI jobs to complete before triggering. This allows the system to analyze all failures (tests and linting) together and create a single comprehensive autofix commit, which is more efficient than creating multiple commits for different failure types.

### Autofix Commit Target
Autofix commits are added directly to the original PR's source branch. This means the developer sees the fixes integrated into their pull request automatically, creating a simpler workflow. This requires appropriate branch write permissions to be configured.

### Handling Invalid AI-Generated Fixes
If the AI-generated fix does not fully resolve all failures or introduces new failures, the system will still create a commit with the partial fixes. The commit message will include a detailed explanation of what was successfully fixed and what limitations or remaining issues exist. This provides partial value to developers and transparency about what the automated system could and could not address.
