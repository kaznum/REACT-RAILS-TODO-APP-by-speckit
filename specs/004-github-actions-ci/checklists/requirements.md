# Specification Quality Checklist: GitHub Actions CI Autofix Workflow

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All validation criteria met

**Clarifications Resolved**:
1. Workflow Trigger Timing: Wait for all CI jobs to complete
2. Autofix PR Target: Commit directly to original PR's source branch
3. Invalid Fix Handling: Create commits with partial fixes and documentation

**Implementation Details Removed**:
- Removed specific technology references (RSpec, Jest, RuboCop, ESLint, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, OpenAI, etc.)
- Replaced with technology-agnostic descriptions (backend/frontend tests, linting, CI automation, containerized environments, AI service)

## Notes

All specification quality requirements are satisfied. The feature is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
