# Specification Quality Checklist: GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items passed. The specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`.

Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1-P4)
- Comprehensive functional requirements covering all aspects of CI workflow
- Measurable success criteria focused on developer experience and system performance
- Well-defined edge cases for error scenarios
- Appropriate assumptions documented
- Clear scope boundaries with out-of-scope items listed

The specification is technology-agnostic while acknowledging the existing tech stack (RSpec, Jest, RuboCop, ESLint, Docker) which is appropriate since this feature extends an existing system.
